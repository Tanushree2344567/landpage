            <p>“I graduated with my B.Tech degree in  two months ago. I chose that field of study because 
                I’ve always been interested in finance and money, and a couple of family members told me
                 it leads to great career options, too. and that’s why I wanted to interview with your firm.
                  This position seems like a great opportunity to advance those skills I just talked about, and continue building my career and challenging myself”</p>
